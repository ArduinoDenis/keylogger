# Keylogger

## What is a Keylogger?

A keylogger, in computer science, is a hardware or software tool capable of recording the keyboard inputs of a computer, meaning it can secretly intercept and capture everything typed on the keyboard without the user's awareness.

### Note: Disable any antivirus software before running the keylogger.
